I am **Yiming Huang (黄一鸣)**, a PhD student and Lee Family scholar in the [CIRCLE](https://tolgabirdal.github.io/) Group at *Imperial College London*, advised by Prof. [Tolga Birdal](https://tolgabirdal.github.io/). 
Previously, I obtained an MSc in Computer Science and Technology from the *University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)*, advised by Prof. [Linyuan Lü](https://linyuanlab.com/).

My research interests primarily focus on developing novel topological deep learning methods for understanding complex and higher-order graph structures. 
I also interested in generative models, graph representation learning, higher-order network analysis, and their interdisciplinary applications.


If you have any academic problems or seeking any form of cooperation, please feel free to email me at y.huang24_at_imperial.ac.uk :smiley:
