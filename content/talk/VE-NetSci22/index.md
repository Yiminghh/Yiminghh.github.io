title: Identifying key players in complex networks through network entanglement
event: NetSci 2022


location: Shanghai (Online)


summary: Vital node identification
abstract: Finding an optimal set of key nodes in a network whose removal from the network would dismantle the network is one of the fundamental research problems of Network Science. In this paper, we introduce an entanglement-based dismantling framework, which captures the network's transport properties and enables new insights into the intrinsic topological features of the complex system.
